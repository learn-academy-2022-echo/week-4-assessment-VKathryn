# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object oriented programming is programming which is centered on objects. I can't recall what functional programming is, so I would indicate how I would go through my resources to brush up on my understanding in an interview, which would be internet searches, the LEARN syllabus & leaning on my cohort. 

Researched answer: Object oriented programming is programming that uses classes of objects and functions (or methods) that work on them. The classes are the blueprint used to create specific objects. Functional programming is different in that Object oriented programming stores data in objects, which is not possible with functional programming. Functional programming takes data and transforms it by making functions. Essentially, the methods for storing and manipulating the data are different.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float is a number that contains a decimal point, and an integer is a number without a decimal point.

Researched answer: A float represents a 'real' number, a number that contains a fraction, represented with a decimal point. an integer is a whole number, represented with no decimal point.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: This means that you don't always need to directly call for a return, it is implied within the language. 

Researched answer: An implicit return in Ruby refers to the fact that every method has an assumed return method. The last evaluated statement in a method will return on it's own. 

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: I can't recall what a block is in Ruby (other than a blocker, but I don't think thats what it's referring to!), so  I would indicate how I would go through my resources to brush up on my understanding in an interview, which would be internet searches, the LEARN syllabus & leaning on my cohort.

Researched answer: This is an anonymous function, inside of a do-end statement or inline with curly braces. It can be passed into methods, and can also contain arguments (|denoted by two pipes on either side|). 


5. What is an instance variable in Ruby?

Your answer: I can't recall what an instance variable is in Ruby, so  I would indicate how I would go through my resources to brush up on my understanding in an interview, which would be internet searches, the LEARN syllabus & leaning on my cohort.

Researched answer: An instance variable is used to create variables that store specific data. These are defined inside of classes and are denoted by the usage of the @ symbol. They are visible anywhere within the scope of the object. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL:  PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database system which began as part of the POSTGRES project at UC Berkeley in 1986. It has been in active development for over 30 years, and hence has a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

2. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is an open-source web application development framework written using the Ruby programming language. A framework provides default structures for your code, databases and webpages for an application, saving time, effort and money.

3. ORM: ORM is Object Relational Mapping, which manually navigates the database for you. You can think of ORM as the go-between between your choice of object oriented programming language and a relational database management system.

4. Active Record: ActiveRecord is an ORM framework; a library which enables you to call SQL functions intuitively and precisely. It is Ruby on Rails' built in ORM and it allows you to interact with data using CRUD methods.

5. Migrations: Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner. ActiveRecord tracks which migrations have already been run so all you need to do is update your source and run <rake db:migrate>, then AR will determine which mirgations should be run.
